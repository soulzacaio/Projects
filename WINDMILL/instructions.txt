
--> Windmill Solitaire uses 104 cards (2 decks). 
--> An Ace is automatically moved to the center. 
--> Four Kings are placed diagonally around the Ace during the game. 
--> These 5 cards form 5 foundation piles. You also have 8 tableau/sail piles (with one card per pile) placed on the board in the form of a cross.

-------------------GOAL:

--> To build all cards on foundations. 
--> You must move 52 cards in order of rank (A, 2,3,...,K,A,2...) on the Ace in the center, wrapping from Ace to King as necessary. 
--> You must move 13 cards in reverse order (K,Q,...,2,A) on the four Kings.

-------------------RULES:

--> Each tableau/sail pile can contain only one card. 
--> The top card of the waste pile and cards in tableau/sail piles are available to play on foundations. 
--> Spaces in tableaus are filled automatically from the waste or stock piles.


--> When you have made all the moves initially available, begin turning over cards from the stock to the waste pile. 
--> he top card from any of the King foundations can be moved to the Ace foundation. 
--> Although, playing from a King Foundation twice is illegal, once the Ace Foundation receives a card from a King Foundation,
the next card must come from elsewhere. 
-->It's obvious that you should do this only if it can help you use other suitable cards from the sails or the stock.
